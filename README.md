Hello world,

I am just entering into the world of programming. I have always been interested with many concepts of programming, and probably can attribute games and world creation with my principle interests. Nevertheless, after finishing grad school, I became very interested specifically in how I could use programs to make my life better, research more effecient, and optimize decision making. I am very interested in game playing AI, as well as predictive finance. I intend to become a machine learning expert, and be able to apply these skills to a varity of situations. My first goal is to become more and more comfortable with the Python programming language, then I intend to build a QGIS plugin that can be used to calculate Albedo values with Landsat 8 images. I also would like to build an AI that could play boardgames. I am passionate about opensource projects and look forward to finding many project that I can become involved with. Some may include: Godot game engine, Python, Tensorflow, LMMS, QGIS, RStudio, Jupyter, Mozilla Firefox, VisualSFM, I2P, Kali Linux, 0 A.D.,
